    \n\nI am a web developer, live in Osasco-SP - Brazil. \n\nI love technology,
    passionate about mobile development,
    fascinated by the embedded features and the numerous
    possibilities that these features can generate as a solution.
    \n\nProgramming in kotlin is a lot of fun,
    it\'s very curious to know even more about this programming language.
    \n\nMy goal is to become a senior-level professional,
    and become a reference on the subject for the whole world.\n\n</string>
